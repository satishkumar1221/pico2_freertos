Creates a new stream buffer using dynamically allocated memory. See \doxylink{stream__buffer_8h_a3c248575ac1b83801db605b32a118f77}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create\+Static()} for a version that uses statically allocated memory (memory that is allocated at compile time).

config\+SUPPORT\+\_\+\+DYNAMIC\+\_\+\+ALLOCATION must be set to 1 or left undefined in Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h for \doxylink{stream__buffer_8h_a39aa4dd8b83e2df7ded291f863fb5fed}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create()} to be available. config\+USE\+\_\+\+STREAM\+\_\+\+BUFFERS must be set to 1 in for Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h for \doxylink{stream__buffer_8h_a39aa4dd8b83e2df7ded291f863fb5fed}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create()} to be available.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Buffer\+Size\+Bytes} & The total number of bytes the stream buffer will be able to hold at any one time.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Trigger\+Level\+Bytes} & The number of bytes that must be in the stream buffer before a task that is blocked on the stream buffer to wait for data is moved out of the blocked state. For example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 1 then the task will be unblocked when a single byte is written to the buffer or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. As another example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 10 then the task will not be unblocked until the stream buffer contains at least 10 bytes or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. If a reading task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires before the trigger level is reached then the task will still receive however many bytes are actually available. Setting a trigger level of 0 will result in a trigger level of 1 being used. It is not valid to specify a trigger level that is greater than the buffer size.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Send\+Completed\+Callback} & Callback invoked when number of bytes at least equal to trigger level is sent to the stream buffer. If the parameter is NULL, it will use the default implementation provided by sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED macro. To enable the callback, config\+USE\+\_\+\+SB\+\_\+\+COMPLETED\+\_\+\+CALLBACK must be set to 1 in Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Receive\+Completed\+Callback} & Callback invoked when more than zero bytes are read from a stream buffer. If the parameter is NULL, it will use the default implementation provided by sb\+RECEIVE\+\_\+\+COMPLETED macro. To enable the callback, config\+USE\+\_\+\+SB\+\_\+\+COMPLETED\+\_\+\+CALLBACK must be set to 1 in Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If NULL is returned, then the stream buffer cannot be created because there is insufficient heap memory available for Free\+RTOS to allocate the stream buffer data structures and storage area. A non-\/\+NULL value being returned indicates that the stream buffer has been created successfully -\/ the returned value should be stored as the handle to the created stream buffer.
