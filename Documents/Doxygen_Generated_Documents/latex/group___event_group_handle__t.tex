An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a meaning. For example, an application may create an event group to convey the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "{}\+A CAN message has been received and is ready for processing"{}, bit 1 might mean "{}\+The application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN network"{}, and bit 2 might mean "{}\+It is time to send a SYNC message onto the \+CAN network"{} etc. A task can then test the bit values to see which events are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified bit or a group of specified bits to be active. To continue the CAN bus example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or send a SYNC).

The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple variable for the same purpose. This is particularly important with respect to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to be set and then tested atomically -\/ as is the case where event groups are used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a \textquotesingle{}rendezvous\textquotesingle{}). \doxylink{event__groups_8h}{event\+\_\+groups.\+h}

Type by which event groups are referenced. For example, a call to \doxylink{event__groups_8c_a2e8622ce280fff2f60ad867dff0a4519}{x\+Event\+Group\+Create()} returns an \doxylink{event__groups_8h_acab96e0b6a5cab7f7b29822b79cc78ed}{Event\+Group\+Handle\+\_\+t} variable that can then be used as a parameter to other event group functions.
