This directory provides an SMP Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel port that can be used with the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK on RP2350. It supports\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Simple CMake INTERFACE libraries, to provide the Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel and also the individual allocator types, without copying code into the user\textquotesingle{}s project.
\item Running the Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel and tasks on either core 0 or core 1, or both.
\item Use of SDK synchronization primitives (such as mutexes, semaphores, queues from pico\+\_\+sync) between Free\+RTOS tasks and code executing on a non Free\+RTOS core, or in IRQ handlers.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that whilst this SMP version can be run on just a single (either) core, it is probably more efficient to use the non SMP version in the main Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel branch in that case.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Using this port}{Using this port}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md38}
You can copy \href{FreeRTOS_Kernel_import.cmake}{\texttt{Free\+RTOS\+\_\+\+Kernel\+\_\+import.\+cmake}} into your project, and add the following in your {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{include(FreeRTOS\_Kernel\_import.cmake)}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will locate the Free\+RTOS kernel if it is a direct sub-\/module of your project, or if you provide the {\ttfamily FREERTOS\+\_\+\+KERNEL\+\_\+\+PATH} variable in your environment or via {\ttfamily -\/DFREERTOS\+\_\+\+KERNEL\+\_\+\+PATH=/path/to/\+Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel} on the CMake command line.

{\bfseries{NOTE\+:}} If you are using version 1.\+3.\+1 or older of the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK then this line must appear before the {\ttfamily pico\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+init()} and will cause Free\+RTOS to be included/required in all RP2040 targets in your project. After this SDK version, you can include the Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel support later in your CMake build (possibly in a subdirectory) and the Free\+RTOS-\/\+Kernel support will only apply to those targets which explicitly include Free\+RTOS support.

As an alternative to the {\ttfamily import} statement above, you can just add this directory directly via thw following (with the same placement restrictions related to the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK version above)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_subdirectory(path/to/this/directory\ FreeRTOS-\/Kernel)}
