Free\+RTOS third party ports can be supported by the Free\+RTOS team, a Free\+RTOS partner or Free\+RTOS community members. Depending on who supports it, the support provided will differ as follows\+:\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Free\+RTOS Team Supported Third Party Free\+RTOS Ports}{Free\+RTOS Team Supported Third Party Free\+RTOS Ports}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md50}

These third party Free\+RTOS ports are supported by the Free\+RTOS team. For a Free\+RTOS team supported third party Free\+RTOS port\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The code has been reviewed by the Free\+RTOS team.
\item Free\+RTOS team has access to the hardware and the test results have been verified by the Free\+RTOS team.
\item Customer queries as well as bugs are addressed by the Free\+RTOS team.
\item The code can be included in Long Term Support (LTS) releases.
\end{DoxyItemize}

A new Free\+RTOS port cannot be directly contributed to this location. Instead, the Free\+RTOS team will decide to take ownership of a partner supported or a community supported Free\+RTOS port based on the community interest.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md51}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Partner Supported Free\+RTOS Ports}{Partner Supported Free\+RTOS Ports}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md51}
