\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Target of this port}{Target of this port}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md24}
This port adds the support that Free\+RTOS applications can call the secure services in Trusted Firmware M(TF-\/M) through Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API based on the ARM Cortex-\/\+M23, Cortex-\/\+M33, Cortex-\/\+M55 and Cortex-\/\+M85 platform.

The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) makes it quicker, easier and cheaper to design security into a device from the ground up. PSA is made up of four key stages\+: analyze, architect, implement, and certify. See \href{https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/platform-security}{\texttt{PSA Resource Page}}.

TF-\/M is an open source project. It provides a reference implementation of PSA for Arm M-\/profile architecture. Please get the details from this \href{https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-m/}{\texttt{link}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Derivation of the source code}{Derivation of the source code}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \doxylink{os__wrapper__freertos_8c}{os\+\_\+wrapper\+\_\+freertos.\+c}} The implementation of APIs which are defined in {\ttfamily /interface/include/os\+\_\+wrapper/mutex.h} in trusted-\/firmware-\/m (tag\+: TF-\/\+Mv2.\+0.\+0). The implementation is based on Free\+RTOS mutex type semaphore.

To build a project based on this port\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Step 1\+: build the secure image. Please follow the {\bfseries{Build the Secure Side}} section for details.
\item Step 2\+: build the nonsecure image. Please follow the {\bfseries{Build the Non-\/\+Secure Side}} for details.

Please refer to this \href{https://trustedfirmware-m.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/}{\texttt{link}} to build the secure side. {\itshape {\bfseries{Note\+:}} {\ttfamily TFM\+\_\+\+NS\+\_\+\+MANAGE\+\_\+\+NSID} must be configured as "{}\+OFF"{} when building TF-\/M}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Build the Non-\/\+Secure Side}{Build the Non-\/\+Secure Side}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md30}
Please copy all the files in {\ttfamily freertos\+\_\+kernel/portable/\+GCC/\+ARM\+\_\+\+CM\mbox{[}23\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}33\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}55\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}85\mbox{]}\+\_\+\+NTZ} into the {\ttfamily freertos\+\_\+kernel/portable/\+Third\+Party/\+GCC/\+ARM\+\_\+\+TFM} folder before using this port. Note that Trust\+Zone is enabled in this port. The TF-\/M runs in the Secure Side.

Please call the API {\ttfamily tfm\+\_\+ns\+\_\+interface\+\_\+init()} which is defined in {\ttfamily /interface/src/os\+\_\+wrapper/tfm\+\_\+ns\+\_\+interface\+\_\+rtos.c} by trusted-\/firmware-\/m (tag\+: TF-\/\+Mv2.\+0.\+0) at the very beginning of your application. Otherwise, it will always fail when calling a TF-\/M service in the Nonsecure Side.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Configuration in Free\+RTOS kernel}{Configuration in Free\+RTOS kernel}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md31}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily config\+RUN\+\_\+\+FREERTOS\+\_\+\+SECURE\+\_\+\+ONLY} This macro should be configured as 0. In this port, TF-\/M runs in the Secure Side while Free\+RTOS Kernel runs in the Non-\/\+Secure Side.
\item {\ttfamily config\+ENABLE\+\_\+\+FPU} The setting of this macro is decided by the setting in Secure Side which is platform-\/specific. If the Secure Side enables Non-\/\+Secure access to FPU, then this macro can be configured as 0 or 1. Otherwise, this macro can only be configured as 0. Please note that Cortex-\/\+M23 does not support FPU. Please refer to \href{https://tf-m-user-guide.trustedfirmware.org/integration_guide/tfm_fpu_support.html}{\texttt{TF-\/M documentation}} for FPU usage on the Non-\/\+Secure side.
\item {\ttfamily config\+ENABLE\+\_\+\+MVE} The setting of this macro is decided by the setting in Secure Side which is platform-\/specific. If the Secure Side enables Non-\/\+Secure access to MVE, then this macro can be configured as 0 or 1. Otherwise, this macro can only be configured as 0. Please note that only Cortex-\/\+M55 and Cortex-\/\+M85 support MVE. Please refer to \href{https://tf-m-user-guide.trustedfirmware.org/integration_guide/tfm_fpu_support.html}{\texttt{TF-\/M documentation}} for MVE usage on the Non-\/\+Secure side.
\item {\ttfamily config\+ENABLE\+\_\+\+TRUSTZONE} This macro should be configured as 0 because TF-\/M doesn\textquotesingle{}t use the secure context management function of Free\+RTOS. New secure context management might be introduced when TF-\/M supports multiple secure context.

To enable calling TF-\/M services by the Non-\/\+Secure Side, the files below should be included in the Free\+RTOS project and built together.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item files in {\ttfamily trusted-\/firmware-\/m/build/api\+\_\+ns/interface/src} These files contain the implementation of PSA Functional Developer APIs which can be called by Non-\/\+Secure Side directly and PSA Firmware Framework APIs in the IPC model. These files should be taken as part of the Non-\/\+Secure source code.
\item files in {\ttfamily trusted-\/firmware-\/m/build/api\+\_\+ns/interface/include} These files are the necessary header files to call TF-\/M services.
\item {\ttfamily trusted-\/firmware-\/m/build/api\+\_\+ns/interface/lib/s\+\_\+veneers.\+o} This object file contains all the Non-\/\+Secure callable functions exported by TF-\/M and it should be linked when generating the Non-\/\+Secure image.
